                <h2>About the Artist</h2>
                <p>
                    Dx Mercado is a multifaceted artist, athlete, filmmaker, researcher, and scholar. His passion for the sciences was solidified during his time at the Philippine Science High School. He went on to play varsity football as a midfielder and compete as a middle-distance runner for the University of the Philippines - Los Baños. He later earned a Master of Science in Criminal Justice, focusing his research on forensics. With a patent for a forensic instrument in the works, Dx may soon add "inventor" to his list of accomplishments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theoretically—and with a nod to modern action movies—Dx could easily have been one of the most skilled assassins. His solid forensic background, Judo medal, and army training give him the tools for it. In 2019, he completed his Limited Warfighting Competency at Camp Riego de Dios, clocking an impressive 11 minutes and 30 seconds in a 2-mile run. As a serialized member of the Armed Forces, Dx boasts unmatched physical and intellectual credentials: he’s a Philippine Science Scholar, a Cum Laude graduate of his master’s program, and he nearly aced his University of the Cordilleras entrance exam with just one mistake, finishing it in less than half the allotted time. Outside the academic sphere, Dx embraces adrenaline, with hobbies like Airsoft and Surfing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite his diverse qualifications, Dx chose to pursue a more peaceful path, immersing himself in the arts while applying his scientific knowledge to his creative work. He has participated in over 50 group exhibitions, showcasing his work in prestigious venues such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines, Sining Makiling Gallery in Laguna, and the Ibag-iw Arts Fest in Baguio City. He once contributed to a Guinness World Record for the longest painting and has curated numerous exhibitions, delivered lectures, and earned accolades in competitions. Among his achievements are winning Juror's Choice at the GSIS National Art Competition and being a finalist in the Metrobank Art and Design Excellence awards. Dx is also an accomplished filmmaker, having directed short films and secured a copyright for one of his screenplays.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2019, Dx briefly stepped away from the arts to focus on academics, completing both his Bachelor of Forensic Science and Master of Science in Criminal Justice in just five years. His research, which centers on crime scene reconstruction, particularly blood pattern analysis, is set to be published in high-impact journals. To support his research, Dx may sell some of his paintings, merging his passion for art with his academic pursuits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his latest artistic ventures, Dx offers unique and innovative works. One of his standout offerings includes commissioned paintings equipped with hidden CCTV installations. These can be discreetly installed, allowing the client to monitor the feed directly from their phone, blending art with functional security. Additionally, Dx creates QR-coded art, where each QR code leads to a customizable landing page, giving clients the ability to personalize the digital experience linked to their artwork. Beyond his artistic endeavors, Dx also provides second opinions on forensic consultations, drawing from his extensive knowledge and training in the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As he continues to blend science and creativity, Dx Mercado remains a dynamic force in both the academic and artistic worlds, always pushing the boundaries of innovation.
